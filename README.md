## 🔐 Authentication

The shell is protected by a login screen with password authentication.

- **Default Password:** `khadiza`
- Password is stored as an **MD5 hash** in the source file.
- 🔁 To change it, edit the line containing the MD5 hash in the PHP source:

```php
$hashedPassword = "e9fe3f2a7b5f4d5011e1b9f8e1d1b9d0"; // Replace with your own md5 hash
```

You can generate your own hash using:

```bash
echo -n 'YourNewPassword' | md5sum
```
